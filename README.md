This C program is a simple menu-driven file handling application that allows users to create, write, append, and read text files. It's written using the C programming language and was developed using the C Programming Editor. The platform I used for writing and testing the code is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and the code was compiled using a standard C/C++ compiler (such as GCC). The program first asks the user for a filename and then continuously presents a menu to perform various file operations. It uses basic file functions like `fopen`, `fputs`, `fgetc`, and `fclose` to handle file input and output. The user can type multiple lines of text, ending input with a `#` on a new line. This project helped me understand how to work with file streams in C and how to interact with files through user input in a command-line environment. It's a useful starting point for beginners learning about file I/O in C programming.
